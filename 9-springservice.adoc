In this exercise we will create a greeting service , we will deploy a new sso server and test our applications. 
Spring Boot has an SSO adapter, we will go in details on how thats configured and we will also run some integrations test. 
Lets get started. 

The Secured example application secures a REST endpoint using Red Hat SSO. (This example expands on the REST API Level 0 example).
Securing an application with SSO enables you to add security to your applications while centralizing the security configuration.

=== The Secured project structure

The SSO example contains:

- the sources for the Greeting service, which is the one which we are going to to secure

- a template file (service.sso.yaml) to deploy the SSO server

- the RH-SSO/Keycloak adapter configuration to secure the service

=== Red Hat SSO deployment configuration
The service.sso.yaml file in this example contains all OpenShift configuration items to deploy a pre-configured Red Hat SSO server. The SSO server configuration has been simplified for the sake of this exercise and does provide an out-of-the-box configuration, with pre-configured users and security settings. The service.sso.yaml file also contains very long lines, and some text editors, such as gedit, may have issues reading this file.

[options="header,footer"]
|=======================
|Change|Reason      |Recommendation
|The default configuration includes both public and private keys in the yaml configuration files.    |We did this because the end user can deploy Red Hat SSO module and have it in a usable state without needing to know the internals or how to configure Red Hat SSO.     |In production, do not store private keys under source control. They should be added by the server administrator.
|The configured clients accept any callback url.    |To avoid having a custom configuration for each runtime, we avoid the callback verification that is required by the OAuth2 specification.    |An application-specific callback URL should be provided with a valid domain name.
|Clients do not require SSL/TLS and the secured applications are not exposed over HTTPS.    |The examples are simplified by not requiring certificates generated for each runtime.     |In production a secure application should use HTTPS rather than plain HTTP.
|The token timeout has been increased to 10 minutes from the default of 1 minute.    |Provides a better user experience when working with the command line examples|From a security perspective, the window an attacker would have to guess the access token is extended. It is recommended to keep this window short as it makes it much harder for a potential attacker to guess the current token.
|=======================

=== Red Hat SSO realm model

The master realm is used to secure this example. There are two pre-configured application client definitions that provide a model for command line clients and the secured REST endpoint.

There are also two pre-configured users in the Red Hat SSO master realm that can be used to validate various authentication and authorization outcomes: admin and alice.
Red Hat SSO users

The realm model for the secured examples includes two users:

*admin*
- The admin user has a password of admin and is the realm administrator. This user has full access to the Red Hat SSO administration console, but none of the role mappings that are required to access the secured endpoints. You can use this user to illustrate the behavior of an authenticated, but unauthorized user.

*alice*
- The alice user has a password of password and is the canonical application user. This user will demonstrate successful authenticated and authorized access to the secured endpoints. An example representation of the role mappings is provided in this decoded JWT bearer token:

----

<1> The iss field corresponds to the Red Hat SSO realm instance URL that issues the token. This must be configured in the secured endpoint deployments in order for the token to be verified.

<2> The roles object provides the roles that have been granted to the user at the global realm level. In this case alice has been granted the example-admin role. We will see that the secured endpoint will look to the realm level for authorized roles.

<3> The resource_access object contains resource specific role grants. Under this object you will find an object for each of the secured endpoints.

<4> The resource_access.secured-example-endpoint.roles object contains the roles granted to alice for the secured-example-endpoint resource.

<5> The preferred_username field provides the username that was used to generate the access token.


=== The application clients

The OAuth 2.0 specification allows you to define a role for application clients that access secured resources on behalf of resource owners. The master realm has the following application clients defined:

*demoapp*
- This is a confidential type client with a client secret that is used to obtain an access token. The token contains grants for the alice user which enable alice to access the Thorntail, Eclipse Vert.x, Node.js and Spring Boot based REST example application deployments.

*secured-example-endpoint*
- The secured-example-endpoint is a bearer-only type of client that requires a example-admin role for accessing the associated resources, specifically the Greeting service.

=== Spring Boot SSO adapter configuration

The SSO adapter is the client side, or client to the SSO server, component that enforces security on the web resources. In this specific case, it is the Greeting service.

Both the SSO adapter and endpoint security are configured in src/main/resources/application.properties.
Example application.properties file
[source, bash]
----
$ # Adapter configuration
keycloak.realm=${realm:master} 
keycloak.realm-key=...
keycloak.auth-server-url=${sso.auth.server.url} 
keycloak.resource=${client.id:secured-example-endpoint} 
keycloak.credentials.secret=${secret:1daa57a2-b60e-468b-a3ac-25bd2dc2eadc} 
keycloak.use-resource-role-mappings=true 
keycloak.bearer-only=true 
# Endpoint security configuration
keycloak.securityConstraints[0].securityCollections[0].name=admin stuff 
keycloak.securityConstraints[0].securityCollections[0].authRoles[0]=example-admin 
keycloak.securityConstraints[0].securityCollections[0].patterns[0]=/api/greeting 
----

- The security realm to be used. 
- The address of the Red Hat SSO server (Interpolation at build time).
- The actual keycloak client configuration.
- Secret to access authentication server.
- Check the token for application level role mappings for the user.
- If enabled the adapter will not attempt to authenticate users, but only verify bearer tokens.
- A simple name for the security constraint.
- A roles needed to access a secured endpont.
- A secured endpoints path pattern.

=== Deploying the Secured example application using the oc CLI client

<1> Create a new OpenShift project. Remember to `replace evalsXX with your username`

    $ oc new-project evalsXX-spring (e.g. evals01)

<2> Navigate to the secured-example (cd secured-example)

<3> Deploy the Red Hat SSO server using the service.sso.yaml

    $ oc create -f service.sso.yaml
    
<4> Switch to this new project in your openshift console. the rest of the guide assumes the new SSO instance in this project.




[source, bash]
----

export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024M -Xss128M -XX:MetaspaceSize=512M -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"

$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests \
          -DSSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL=$(oc get route secure-sso -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"/auth\n"}')
----

This process generates the uberjar file as well as the OpenShift resources and deploys them to the current project
Following is the openshift webconsole from a deployed project

image::sso_springfinalocpshot.png[Secured App Deployment]

Lets move on to test our application both on the terminal and the browser.

=== Authenticating to the Secured example application API endpoint

The Secured example application provides a default HTTP endpoint that accepts GET requests if the caller is authenticated and authorized. The client first authenticates against the Red Hat SSO server and then performs a GET request against the Secured example application using the access token returned by the authentication step.
Getting the Secured example application API endpoint

In a terminal application, execute the oc get routes command to get all routes for this project including your secured applications route.

=== Authenticating HTTP requests using the command line

Request a token by sending a HTTP POST request to the Red Hat SSO server. In the following example, the jq CLI tool is used to extract the token value from the JSON response.

The secured example endpoint URL. For more information, see Getting the Secured example application API endpoint.

The jq command-line tool (optional). To download the tool and for more information, see https://stedolan.github.io/jq/.

Lets request an access token with curl, the credentials, and <SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL>

[source, bash]
----
curl -sk -X POST https://<SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL>/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token \
  -d grant_type=password \
  -d username=alice\
  -d password=password \
  -d client_id=demoapp \
  -d client_secret=1daa57a2-b60e-468b-a3ac-25bd2dc2eadc
----

extract the token and assign it on the shell like this `TOKEN=`

<SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL> is the url of the secure-sso service.

The attributes, such as username, password, and client_secret are usually kept secret, but the above command uses the default provided credentials with this example for demonstration purpose.

Invoke the Secured service. Attach the access (bearer) token to the HTTP headers:
[source, bash]
----
    $ curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://<SERVICE_HOST>/api/greeting

    {
        "content": "Hello, World!",
        "id": 2
    }
----

<SERVICE_HOST> is the URL of the secured example endpoint. For more information, see Getting the Secured example application API endpoint.

The access token is a JSON Web Token, so you can decode it using the http://jwt.io[JWT Debugger].

In a web browser, navigate to the JWT Debugger website.

Select RS256 from the Algorithm drop down menu.
Make sure the web form has been updated after you made the selection, so it displays the correct RSASHA256(…​) information in the Signature section. If it has not, try switching to HS256 and then back to RS256.

Paste the following content in the topmost text box into the VERIFY SIGNATURE section:
[source, bash]
----
        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
        MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAoETnPmN55xBJjRzN/cs30OzJ9olkteLVNRjzdTxFOyRtS2ovDfzdhhO9XzUcTMbIsCOAZtSt8K+6yvBXypOSYvI75EUdypmkcK1KoptqY5KEBQ1KwhWuP7IWQ0fshUwD6jI1QWDfGxfM/h34FvEn/0tJ71xN2P8TI2YanwuDZgosdobx/PAvlGREBGuk4BgmexTOkAdnFxIUQcCkiEZ2C41uCrxiS4CEe5OX91aK9HKZV4ZJX6vnqMHmdDnsMdO+UFtxOBYZio+a1jP4W3d7J5fGeiOaXjQCOpivKnP2yU2DPdWmDMyVb67l8DRA+jh0OJFKZ5H2fNgE3II59vdsRwIDAQAB
        -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
----

This is the master realm public key from the Red Hat SSO server deployment of the Secured example application.

Paste the token output from the client output into the Encoded box.

The Signature Verified sign is displayed on the debugger page.

=== Authenticating HTTP requests using the web interface

In addition to the HTTP API, the secured endpoint also contains a web interface to interact with.

Lets see how security is enforced, how you authenticate, and how you work with the authentication token. In a web browser, navigate to the endpoint URL.

==== Perform an unauthenticated request:

Click the Invoke button. 

image::sso_springmain.png[Unauthenticated Secured Example Web Interface]

The services responds with an HTTP 401 Unauthorized status code.

image::sso_springunauthenticated.png[Unauthenticated Error Message]
        
==== Perform an authenticated request as a user:

Click the Login button to authenticate against Red Hat SSO. You will be redirected to the SSO server.

Log in as the Alice user. You will be redirected back to the web interface.
You can see the access (bearer) token in the command line output at the bottom of the page.

image::sso_springalice.png[Authenticated Secured Example Web Interface (as Alice)]

Click Invoke again to access the Greeting service.

Confirm that there is no exception and the JSON response payload is displayed. This means the service accepted your access (bearer) token and you are authorized access to the Greeting service.

image::sso_springinvokealice.png[The Result of an Authenticated Greeting Request (as Alice)]

==== Perform an authenticated request as an admininstrator:

`user: admin, pass:admin`

- Click the Invoke button.

- Confirm that this sends an unauthenticated request to the Greeting service.

- Click the Login button and log in as the admin user.

image::sso_springadmin.png[Authenticated Secured Example Web Interface (as admin)]

Click the Invoke button.

The service responds with an HTTP 403 Forbidden status code because the admin user is not authorized to access the Greeting service.
image::sso_springunauthorized.png[Unauthorized Error Message]

=== Running Integration tests with SSO
Now that we have deployed an example greeting service and secured it. In most cases we would like to test and ensure integrations between services and components are working.

In a your terminal application, navigate to the directory with your project.
- Create the Red Hat SSO server application:

- Create a new project for integrations `evalsXX-spring-integration`. Remember to `replace evalsXX with your username`
[source, bash]
----
oc create -f service.sso.yaml
----

- Wait until the Red Hat SSO server is ready. Go to the Web console or view the output of oc get pods to check if the pod running the Red Hat SSO server is ready.

- Execute the integration tests:

[source, bash]
----

export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024M -Xss128M -XX:MetaspaceSize=512M -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"

 mvn clean verify -Popenshift,openshift-it -DSSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL=$(oc get route secure-sso -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"/auth\n"}')
